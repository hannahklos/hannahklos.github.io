        		Bethany's story:
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Bethany started surfing at a very young age and dreamed of a surfing career</li>
        		<li>At 13 years old Bethany got attacked by a 14-foot tiger shark</li>
        		<li>After only one month after the attack Bethany decided to surf again</li>
        		<li>2 years later she won her first national surfing title</li>
        		<li>She has two movies in honor of her story and has a beautiful family</li>
    		</ul>

    		<p>
        		Bethany Hamilton has shown that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. No matter how tired and exhausted we are and how difficult life is, it is always worth fighting for the light at the end of the tunnel.
