        <h1>Mildly Amusing</h1>
        <h2>In need of a laugh</h2>
          <p>Whenever I get sad or need a laugh I know what to look for on YouTube. FailArmy has THE best fails and most funny videos of all times. However, one of my favorite fail videos is with animals, they are just way too entertaining. </p>

        <h2>The world is just weird</h2>
           <p>I have never seen a Google Maps car driving around, but I have always wondered what kind of pictures they have captured and let me tell you some of those are pretty funny. One day I hope I will be the one who is able to photobomb Google Maps.</p>
