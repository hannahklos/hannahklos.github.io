    <p>I am originally from Germany but have been living in the states for about 6 years now. I will be graduating with a Business degree and a major in Marketing. My goal is to find a job here in the states and get a greencard, which makes iving here a lot easier.</p>
    <p>I grew up in a small town in Germany called Tegernsee. We can go skiing, swimming, biking, hiking, and so much more. I am not going to lie, I miss it sometimes. Here, I have to drive most places, back home I just biked or walked everywhere.</p>
